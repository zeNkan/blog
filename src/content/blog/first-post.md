# # Welcome to My Little Corner of the Cyber World

Hey, I'm Lars, a Cyber Security Engineer based in Stockholm. Welcome to my blog. Here I will share my thoughts, experiences, and maybe even the occasional rant about the world of cyber security.

I've been hooked on computers for basically as long as I can remember, and geeked out hacking presentations when I was a teenager but never thought I was smart enough to do it myself. But thanks to a lot of work and amazing people I've been able to make it my career.

## ## When I'm not working, you'll find me

- Hiking through the Swedish wilderness
- Exploring the open road on my motorcycle
- Hanging out with the animals on our farm (yes, there's a farm!)
- Tinkering with code on the occasional side project

## ## So, why am I starting this blog?

Honestly? It's a way for me to organize my thoughts, dive deeper into things that interest me, and hopefully share some insights that might help you along the way.

Expect to find rants, book reviews, tool recommendations, and maybe even the occasional rabbit picture.
