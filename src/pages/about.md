I'm a security engineer and former pentester and system administrator. On this blog I aim to share what I learn as I find writing down my thoughts and ideas helps me to understand them better.

In the security world I consider myself a generalist. I've done everything from pentesting to incident response to security architecture. I'm particularly interested in the intersection of security and software development. I'm also a big fan of automation and I'm always looking for ways to automate security tasks.

In my spare time I enjoy the outside and live currently on a horse farm with my wonderful girlfriend, just out side of Stockholm, Sweden.
